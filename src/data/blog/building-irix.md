## What is IRIX
Gyms and fitness clubs spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to keep personal trainers on payroll. Personal training improves retention, but it doesn’t scale. Trainers are expensive and capacity-limited, so most members never get guidance. I used to work at the YMCA. We spent ridiculous amounts of money purchasing "smart” gym machines that guide members through workouts. These machines are also prohibitively expensive. <br><br>

This inspired my cofounder and I to create <a href="https://tryirix.com">IRIX</a>. We automate the personal training experience for gyms via lightweight smart glasses. Members checkout the glasses from the front desk, then are guided through personalized workouts via audio prompts. IRIX uses computer vision and onboard sensors to detect+log reps, rest, and fatigue to provide contextual coaching and plan future workouts. <br><br>

We let gyms offer personalized training to every member without adding staff or expensive equipment. <br><br>
